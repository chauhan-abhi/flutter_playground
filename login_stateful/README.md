A simple login application primarily focused on **STATE MANAGEMENT** using following methods:

## Stateful widget
  - To run this implementation, comment the Provider codein [app.dart](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/blob/master/login_stateful/lib/src/app.dart) and attach [LoginScreen](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/blob/master/login_stateful/lib/src/screens/login_screen.dart) to body.
  
  
## BLOC pattern(Single Global Instance) 
  - To run this implementation, comment the Provider code in [app.dart](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/blob/master/login_stateful/lib/src/app.dart) and attach [LoginScreenBloc](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/blob/master/login_stateful/lib/src/screens/login_screen_bloc.dart) to body.
  
  
## BLOC pattern(Scoped Instance)]
