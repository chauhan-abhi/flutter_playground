# Exploring Flutter widgets

This repository contains sample apps build while exploring flutter widgets.

## [Calculator App](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/tree/master/calculatorapp)
- Simple app implementing +,-,*,/ features

## [Network Request](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/tree/master/http_requests_flutter)
- App using flutter http module to get a list of images and load them from network inside a widget.

## [Login Design](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/tree/master/login_app_flutter)
- Login app UI

## [State Management using Streams](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/tree/master/login_stateful)
  - using Stateful Widgets
  - using Global Instance(BLOC pattern) 
  - using Scoped Instance(BLOC pattern)
  - using RxDart
  
  Downside of the last two approaches is complexity in merging of two streams.
  Solution: [RxDart Implementation](https://github.com/chauhan-abhi/flutter_starter_experiments/tree/master/rxdart_login)
