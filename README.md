# Exploring Flutter widgets

This repository contains sample apps build while exploring flutter widgets.

## Calculator App
- Simple app implementing +,-,*,/ features

## Network Request
- App using flutter http module to get a list of images and load them from network inside a widget.

## Login Design
- Login app UI

## State Management using Streams
  - using Stateful Widgets
  - using Global Instance(BLOC pattern) 
  - using Scoped Instance(BLOC pattern)
  
  Downside of the last two approaches is complexity in merging of two streams.
  Possible solution: [RxDart](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart)
